Welcome to my Prompt Engineering portfolio. This repository is a hands-on demonstration of my expertise in designing optimized instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, complex challenges meet elegant solutions, turning intentions into precise and impactful results.

My approach leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques, aiming not just to generate answers but to orchestrate AI behavior to solve complex problems and deliver strategic value.

## 💡 Highlighted Skills and Methodologies

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Guiding the AI through step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.
- **Few-Shot Learning:** Providing carefully selected examples to refine the model’s behavior and tone.
- **Persona Prompting:** Assigning identities and specializations to the AI for more authoritative responses.
- **Prompt Chaining:** Combining multiple prompts to create sophisticated workflows.
- **Self-Correction / Self-Consistency:** Designing prompts that allow the AI to validate and refine its own outputs.
- **Structured Output:** Defining precise output formats (JSON, Markdown) for easier downstream processing.
- **Meta-Prompting:** Creating prompts that define the AI’s own behavior when interacting with users.

## 🎯 Projects and Detailed Analyses

### 🚀 ULTIMATE PROMPT MASTER — INTEGRATED ANALYSIS & APPLICATION SYSTEM v6.0

- **Challenge:**  
  Build a robust AI-based system to scientifically analyze job postings, optimize résumés for ATS, generate personalized cover letters, and design application and networking strategies, mitigating scam risks.

- **Approach:**  
  Multifaceted methodology:  
  - Chain-of-Thought for deep analysis  
  - Self-Consistency for anti-scam validation  
  - Multi-Criteria Analysis for weighted scoring  
  - Tree-of-Thoughts for optimized materials and interview strategies  
  Turns the AI into a senior technical recruitment specialist.

- **Key Results:**  
  Generates quantitative compatibility analyses, classifies job risks, scores opportunities based on multiple criteria, and produces ultra-personalized application deliverables.

- **Full Prompt:**  
  See [`job-application-optimizer prompt.txt`](prompts/job-application-optimizer/job-application-optimizer%20prompt.txt)

- **Technical Analysis:**  
  See [job application optimizer analysis.md](https://github.com/jl-07/prompt-engineering-mastery/blob/main/prompts/job-application-optimizer/job%20application%20optimizer%20analysis.md)

- **Example Output:**  
  See [`Job application optimizer output example 1.md`](prompts/job-application-optimizer/Job%20application%20optimizer%20output%20example%201.md)

### 🧠 Optimized Prompt for Maximum Extraction of Questions and Requests

- **Challenge:**  
  Develop a meta-prompt that instructs the AI (simulating Grok) to deeply understand, refine, execute, and optimize its answers for any user request, ensuring maximum accuracy and usefulness, especially for technical or multifaceted contexts.

- **Approach:**  
  Deep Understanding, Iterative Request Refinement, Contextualized Execution, Continuous Optimization for Excellence. Enables the AI to act as a "prompt engineer" for itself.

- **Key Results:**  
  The AI can break down complex requests, propose evaluation criteria, generate high-quality technical and creative content, and proactively suggest improvements.

- **Full Prompt:**  
  See [`intelligent-response.txt`](prompts/intelligent-response/intelligent-response.txt)

- **Technical Analysis:**  
  See [`intelligent response analysis.md`](prompts/intelligent-response/intelligent%20response%20analysis.md)

- **Example Output:**  
  See [`intelligent response output example 1.md`](prompts/intelligent-response/intelligent%20response%20output%20example%201.md)
